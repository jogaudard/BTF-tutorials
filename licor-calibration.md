## Introduction

Please refer to page XX of the Li-840A manual for the exact precedure to calibrate the licor. This tutorial aims at providing additionnal information specific to the two licors belonging to the Between The Fjord group.

In short, you will need to run the licor with a gaz containing zero CO<sub>2</sub> and telling it, do the same with a gaz with a known CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (span gas), and check the constants.

Required material:

-   Li-840A gas analyzer;
-   Tubings and flux meter;
-   Battery;
-   Computer with Licor software and cable.

## Zero gas

N<sub>2</sub> is commonly used as a zero gas. At BIO, you will need to book the fume hood in the lab 3F04 by the marine biologists (no N<sub>2</sub> on our side of the building).

Steps to foolow:

1.  Open the valve for N<sub>2</sub> in the fume hood;
2.  Connect the flux meter and check that it is at 1 L/mn;
3.  Connect the tubes to the Li-840A inlets;
4.  Turn on the Li-840A by connecting the battery;
5.  Connect the Li-840A to the computer and to the softwar;

Then in the softwar:

1.  Wait until the cell temperature is at 51Â°C and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stable;
2.  View &gt; Calibration &gt; Zero &gt; Make zero
3.  Check if values are stable and near 0.

## Span gaz

The span gas we use is CO<sub>2</sub> at 998ppm. The bottle is located in lab XX. The procedure is the same as for the zero gas, some extra steps are described in figure XX. The bottle is under pressure, do not open the valve fully and make sure to check the flux meter. In the software, the calibration is done under "span gas".

## Constants

Constants are on a piece of paper delivered by Licor and are specifics to each Li-840A. Check the serie number of the Li-840A. In View &gt; Calibration &gt; Advanced, you can adjust the constants and send them to the Li-840A. This should be done after the calibration with zero and span gas.
